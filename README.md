# BFS-DFS-Maze-Solver

This project is a Maze Solver that uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms to find the path from a starting point to an endpoint in a maze.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mazen251/BFS-DFS-Maze-Solver.git
cd BFS-DFS-Maze-Solver-master
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the maze solver, use the following command:

```bash
python maze_solver.py
```

You can specify the maze file and the algorithm (BFS or DFS) to use:

```bash
python maze_solver.py --maze_file path/to/maze.txt --algorithm bfs
```

## Algorithms

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
